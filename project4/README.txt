This folder contains data for Project 4 for the CSC420 class: http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/CSC420.html.

The directory contains 6 cars out of original 20 cars from the EPFL car viewpoint dataset.  More about the format of the data can be found in the epfl_gims08.txt file. 

In CADcode you will find some visualization code for the CAD models of car. It also has a data directory where you have a few CAD models. Use these models to align them to the point clouds obtained from the videos. To visualize the CAD models, cd to CADcode and run:
viz_3D_model_dir
